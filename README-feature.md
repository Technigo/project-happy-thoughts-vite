# TypeSCript Project

The goal is to practice TypeScript by rewriting an old project, I picked the project of the Happy Thoughts messaging app. 

## How to Get Started

1. **Clone the old project:**
   - If you haven't already, clone your old Happy Thoughts repository.
   - Create a new branch for the TypeScript project:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/rtypescript
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies & Start Development Server:**
   - Install required packages and start the development server:
     ```bash
     npm i && code . && npm run dev
     ```
   - Install TypeScript: 
     ```bash
     npm install -g typescript
     ```

     Check if TypeScript is installed correctly:
     ```bash
     tsc -v
     ```

3. **Development Workflow:**
   - Rewrite components and files using TypeScript, following best practices.
   - Run the app to ensure everything works as expected.
   - Use the Problems panel to fix any TypeScript-related issues.

4. **Deployment:**
   - When you're done, choose one of the following deployment methods:
     - **Netlify Branch Deploy:** Create a branch deploy to preview changes.
     - **Merge to Main:** Merge your branch to `master/main` to trigger a redeploy.
