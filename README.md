# Happy thoughts Project

This project aims to develop a social media application where users can share positive thoughts and like others' posts. 

### The Problem

The main challenge was maintaining responsiveness and interactivity of the user interface while efficiently managing communications with the server.
To tackle this issue, I used React.js with special tools called useState and useEffect for managing data and localStorage to remember what users do.
