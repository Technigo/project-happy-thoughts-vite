# Happy Thoughts

In this project, we were told to practice React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

### The Problem

Lots of tips were given during code sessions and in the class repository on GitHub. I talked a lot with classmates in our own channels. Seasoned with YouTube videos and AI. If I had more time I would try to make the project look exactly like the template. And to really understand absolutely every line of code that is in the project.
