# Happy Thoughts

In this week's Technigo project, I practiced my React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API while building a Twitter (X)-like project and using the useEffect hook.

### The Problem

To solve this project I firstly planned my components and what should belong to them. I was thinking back and forth about having one styling file but resonated that when building larger projects it's easier with seperate styling files for each component. Then I started to build the code with help from google, chat gpt, my team and the exercise material for the week. The most challenging part was to get the POST fetch to work and also the styling. If I had more time I would focus on cleaning up the styling in the code and try out adding a loading state for the recent thoughts.

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
