# Happy Thoughts Project

A React app that uses GET and POST requests from an API to display that data on the UI. Users can post and like thoughts.

## Getting Started with the Project
First, I used GET and POST requests to retrieve data from the API, added error handling, and created the components. Lastly, I styled the page.

### The Problem

The most difficult part was understanding how the POST request worked and how to implement it.
