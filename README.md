## Happy thoughts Project

This project is aimed to interact with external data using API GET and POST request, and then use the data fetched to update the UI.
User can post their happy thoughts in the form and like the thoughts. There's also the counter of the posts user likes and sends

## Getting Started with the Project

I get started with the project by first testing out the API requests. After API calls are sucussfullt set up, I styled the website by creating css module for each component which ensures the css files are local scoped.
After that, I cleaned up the component files and set up the error handling.

## The Problem

I spent several hours understanding the useEffect hook and the error handling for promises as well as the async/await functions. Apart from that, I also explored how to implement Lottie Animation which spices up my website.
