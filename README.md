# Happy thoughts Project

In this week's project, you'll be able to practice your React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

It was very fun to learn how to fetch AND create data. I broke down the problem into bits.

1. Create thought list.
2. Like thoughts.
3. Post new thoughts.
4. The styling.

Working structured like this is a good technique to not feel overwhelmed.

A very useful thing I learned was the useEffect hook which lets you tell React to run some code once when the component renders.
