# Project Happy Thoughts

This project is about practicing React skills by fetching and posting data to an API while building a Twitter (X)-like project.

### The Problem

I found it quite difficult to figure out how to get this project going. I basically used Diegos helper-code from github to get things in place. Even though there was a lot of help, the code needed tweaking to work with my project - I still had to make it my own, but it helped me a lot!

ChatGPT has been a great resource to have, and the team has a pool of knowledge. I also used YT and Google to find solutions. I even needed to go back to week 5's material to do a recap since I felt so lost at the beginning.

In the end I think this was a fun project and if I had more time I would aim for more of the stretch goals. The intermediate strech goals are indeed met and I'm happy with that.
