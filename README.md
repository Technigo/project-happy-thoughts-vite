# Happy thoughts Project

We had to build an API to collect Happy Thoughts, making it look similar to X, amd make it as closer as possible to the original design

### The Problem

First of all, we had to plan how the app should work, thinking how many components, the reason for each one, and the name, I decided to create 3 different components one for the message, another for the items, and a 3rd one for the list of comments that would be displayed. 

I had several problems starting with the planing, the logic was not very clear for me (and still), I got a lot og help from chatgpt

amother problem for me was the styling, but I managed to make it look almost exacly the same.

If I had more time I would try to make the Advanced stretch goals
