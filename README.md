# Unhappy thoughts Project

In this week's project, you'll be able to practice your React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

### The Problem

Using react and useEffect we should create an app fetching messages from an API. The user should be able to like the messages, aswell as post new ones.

- I started with fetching the posts and displaying the data needed. I decided I wanted to use a resonable amount of components.
- I then created the like feature, which I had some issues with at first. (I doubled the likes, instead of adding one).
- I then moved on to styling, to rest my brain and get a better sense of what I was building.
- A couple of days later I came back to build the new thoughts feature. I decided to do a fetch every time the user posted a new thought since I wanted to get the updated thoughts from my classmates. For the same reason I added a fetch interval.
- Finished off by adding the feature of making liked hearts pink instead of grey.
- _I am now done with the basic requirements._

- Added a counter to the form
- Added error message when post is denied (although, the API doesn't return WHY)

### week 15

This week we built our own API and switched out Technigos.

#### Next steps

- I should style the header
- Do some stretch
