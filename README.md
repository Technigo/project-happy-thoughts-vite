# Unhappy thoughts Project

In this week's project, you'll be able to practice your React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

We split this project into 7 parts:

1. **Planning:** We started with a Trello board and project plan.
2. **Flow Chart:** To understand the flow, we created a flow chart.
3. **Mob Programming:** We began with data fetching from an API.
4. **Interval-Based Refresh:** We added a 5-second data refresh interval.
5. **Component Development:** We built list and post thought components.
6. **Parallel Work:** We divided tasks and worked in separate branches.
7. **Stretch Goals:** Additional features were mostly added by team members Sebastian and Diana.
