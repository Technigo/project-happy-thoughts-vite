### The Problem

The task was to create a Twitter-like app with React, where you would be able to write your own happy thoughts as well as view and like others' messages.

I started by trying to build code according to the instructional videos in this week's materials. With this I managed to make first API call and display the other users' recent messages by using the fetch command, useState and useEffect hooks. After this I ran into some issues and ChatGPT helped me forward.

If I had more time, I would've loved to tackle the stretch goals - but that will be for another time when I eventually come back to upgrade this project to the next level.
