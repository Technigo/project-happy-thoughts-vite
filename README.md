### Convert a React project into TypeScript
We had to convert to Typescript one of our projects were we used React, I decided to go for TÂ´Happy thoughts, because it has been one of my favorite projects.


### The Problem

I had to instal Typescript amd I created a new branch with the same name, I decided to fix the corrections that I had from Matilda when she reviewed the original project, so I could have it 100% ready to convert it to Typescript. 

I am still strugling a bit determinating where the data types needs to be define, so I was trying to guiding my self with the course material, extra videos on Youtube and Chat gpt.
