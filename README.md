# Happy thoughts Project

In this week's project, we practiced React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API, building a Twitter-like website where the user can read and like other people's happy thoughts as well as sharing their own.

### The Problem

I approached the problem by laying out the components, functions and different calls for APIs I would need to do. There is a GET request to get the posts, a POST request to post the user input and a POST request to post a like. First I made sure the GET request worked. Then I styled the website and created an input field and added the API call to POST user input. Last step was to implement the "like" function.

If I had more time, I would maybe ad an animation for when the site is loading, right now I just have a text.
