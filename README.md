# Happy thoughts Project

The goal is to create a Twitter (X)-like app that uses React state to fetch and post data to an API. The app includes an input field for submitting new posts and a wall displaying posted comments. Each comment has a like button that changes color when clicked, and the submit button shows a 'loading' state during data fetch. The app is fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop, and is designed with accessibility in mind.

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server
