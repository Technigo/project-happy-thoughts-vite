# Happy Thoughts

In this week's project, you'll be able to practice your React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I initially started out with reading the instructions for the project and planning out how many different components I thought I would need and laid out a basic structure. I then tried to determine what logic should be applied in which component.
Tools and techniques used: JS/React, useState, useEffect, API, async/await.

Any issues that popped up were solved by googling, using stack overflow, discussing with classmates and prompting ChatGPT.

If I had had more time I would have looked at using localStorage to store info and set the states using it.
