# Happy thoughts Project

In this week's project, you'll be able to practice your React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

### The Problem

I have used useState and useEffect hooks to handle state and API fetching and posting. I'm also using components to handle different parts of the app, the form component for posting and the thoughts list for reading previous posts. I'm happy with how it turned out!
