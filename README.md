# Happy thoughts Project

This is an app where we had to work with an external API using GET and POST requests in order to update a UI. In this app, you can post your thoughts to be seen by everyone on a public wall, where everyone can view and like the posted thoughts.

### The Problem

The main problem was organizing all the components and ensuring all functions worked between them. I was stuck for three days trying to make the like button work until I realized that I wasn't passing the `_id` prop, but the key. If I had more time, I would like to improve the app with some user-friendly loading information.
