# Unhappy thoughts Project

In this week's project, you'll be able to practice your React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

### The Problem

My first step was to create components and the needed CSS files. After that I connected the componets and tried to work from parent to child component, because I didn't want to make the same mistake as in the previous project.

By the time I reached the SingleThought.jsx, I realized that I could have made a separat component for the like function. Nevertheless, I continued to leave important code in the SingleThought.jsx.

My struggles began, when I couldn't figure out why I cannot post the thoughts. Hearing from the session and checking again in the material, it was the "headers" that was missing.

Another struggle was the timestamp for the posts. I saw that people were using the moment library to get the time. At first I couldn't make the code work, until I realized that I had to install the library. My assumption was, that the library was already intigrated.

This time I reached for some stretch goals, which I lately avoided to do.

If I had more time, I'd like to add a dislike button (old YouTube times).
