# Happy Thoughts

A Twitter-like application, using useEffect, useState and Fetch APIallowing the user to interact with the application by adding and liking posts. 

### The Problem

I started the project by sketching the different components in FigJam and creating an architectural flow of how they would be connected with eachother and to define the prompts and states that I would need.

I used the course material and AI to solve the problem and I also used the inspector and dev tool for creating the CSS and the component architecture. 

Issues i would like to work on if I had more time:
1. Figure out how to make the h1 element look the same as the example. The font-weight appears to be less than in the example.
2. Debugging & CSS
3. I'm assigning "loading" a value but only the setLoading is used. Is that an issue?
