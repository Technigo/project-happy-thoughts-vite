# Happy thoughts Project

In this week's project, you'll be able to practice your React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

### The Problem

I started by created the components I believed I needed. My goal was to have the App.jsx as clean as possible and let the components handle the tasks: GET, POST and the returns. I realised quite late that I couldnt insert the new post into the Thoughts list without merging most of the code into one component. Tried many different options but still haven't managed figuring it out. So with more time I would probably create more, but simpler components or just divide it differently. I would also have liked to reach more of the strechgoals.

I managed quite far with the class material but halfway I got stuck and used ChatGPT, Google and previous students code as my help.

Something I find very challenged is to plan correctly and I feel that I don't know what is right and wrong and doubt my solutions a lot.
