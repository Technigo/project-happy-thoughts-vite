# Happy thoughts Project

## The project

In this project the trickiest part was to figure out how to structure the code. I wanted the create custom hooks for my GET and POST requests to make the code leaner and easier to read, but figuring out how to use it after I created it took a while.

If I had more time I would probably break out different parts into separate components.
