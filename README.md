# Happy thoughts Project

To practice React state skills and fetching and posting data to an API, I have created an application where you can post and like messages.

### The Problem

I looked through the API and the design we had to follow. I broke the task down to smaller pieces and started to build the application step by step by following my smaller tasks. I searched for possible solutions when I got stuck and also talked about the code with another person in the tech industry to get new ideas on how to approach the problem.

if I had more time I would try to break out code from some of the components to make them cleaner.
