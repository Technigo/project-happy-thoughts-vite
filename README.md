# Happy thoughts Project

React project where the user can read, share and vote on happy thoughts.

### The Problem

Followed the brief as tightly as possible. didnt have to much time (a day) so would have gone for the streach goals if I had more time.
Followed what I learned from this weeks excercise and applied that to this project.

### View it live
