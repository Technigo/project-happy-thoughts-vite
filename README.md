# Happy thoughts Project – TypeScript edition

## Converting to TypeScript

In this project I converted a previous project to TypeScript in order to learn. It was definiately a challenge trying to understand the syntax, where to use what and so on. I will need to use it more to feel comfortable writing it for sure.

## The project

In this project the trickiest part was to figure out how to structure the code. I wanted the create custom hooks for my GET and POST requests to make the code leaner and easier to read, but figuring out how to use it after I created it took a while.

If I had more time I would probably break out different parts into separate components.
