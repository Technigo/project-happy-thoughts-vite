### The Problem

One of the main challenges in this project was managing state and ensuring real-time updates of thoughts and likes from the API. To address this, I used React's useState and useEffect hooks to fetch and update data dynamically.

The implementation of the like button posed challenges initially, but it was resolved by sending POST requests to the API to update the number of likes for each thought when the button was clicked.

Additionally, at the moment of submission, the styling was not finalized, and it was planned to be updated later in the development process to ensure a consistent and polished user interface.
