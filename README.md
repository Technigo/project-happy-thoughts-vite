# Happy Thoughts

In this week's project, you'll be able to practice your React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API. :)

### The Problem

I had some trouble working with the API's at first. Getting the message feed to show worked pretty fast for me, the one that took the longest was the like button POST request. The problem was i had an "<" at the start of the url... I solved the problem by taking a break, coming back again. 
I also found it hard to understand how to update it... It worked out in the end!
As always, I have an amazing team that helps with issues and motivation.
