## Getting Started with the Project

This week's project involved building a React app similar to Twitter. Users could share thoughts, like posts, and see timestamps. It focused on fetching and posting data using React state management and interacting with an API.

### The Problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?
I studied the template to be able to be able to plan the structure of the components. Still a struggle for me, mostly in the beginning of the projects, to connect the different components, get them to work and render the results I expect. 
I fetched and posted data to an API using the fetch function which went smootly.
If I had more time:
- Convert 60min+ to show h + min.
- Change the like function to maybe just add 1 like. Now you can click endlessly. Add appropriate styling so that it's clear for the user which thoughts they have liked.
- When the user submits a thought it doesn't show up straight away unless you refresh. Would have wanted to change that and added an animation to it.
- Designed a cuter header! Putting more effort, time and making it look more professional. Now I mainly focused on the basic requirements.
- Add more features!

ðŸš¨ There seem to be some kind of css issue when I try the netlify link on my phone. On my computers it looks fine. The arrow svg inside my scroll to the top button isn't centered within the button. The submit button font is white instead of black. Let me know if you also get this or if there is any other issue. Will look into it!
