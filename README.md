# Unhappy Thoughts Project

In this week's project, I'll be able to practice my React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code, and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev

## Instructions

1. Navigate to the project's root directory:

```bash
cd project-happy-thoughts
