# Happy thoughts Project

In this week's project, you'll be able to practice your React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

### The Problem

I found this week very difficult, so much more than the last few weeks. I still dont understand props, and when to use state, useEffect etc. 

I kept linking to the wrong thing in the API, and often found my solution in tweeking the names.

The main struggle for me was to display the input form, and especially to post the new message without manually reloading. I found a solution for this, however, the page reloads. I would prefer if the message just showed up without an obvious reload, but I was not able to do that. 

The hearts and counts were also a struggle.

I would have done more css and strechgoals if I had more time. I also would have spent more time on comments, I did not really manage to describe my code as well as I usually do - partially because I do not understand everything, but mostly because of time limitations.
