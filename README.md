# Happy Thoughts

In this week's project, you'll be able to practice your React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

It was a quite hard project, as the post request was something I have never done before. I looked into materials from the boot camp and infomation in the Internet, and found a way to do that.
Playing with React, and thinking about when to use which hooks is still very difficult for me. I need more practice for sure, but figuring it out and and using it into my code is fun.

I planed in the beginning which components I need for this project. As I am new to React, I couldn't plan which states, useffects, and other hooks I would like to use. I think it would be better, so I will try the next project.

With this project, I think I have done almost all that I could do, but there are things that could be better written, so I would come back in the feture, when I know more about React and other hooks and make it better.
