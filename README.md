# Unhappy thoughts Project

In this week's project, you'll be able to practice your React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

I approached the problem by first planning and visualizing the component structure using a flowchart. I kept the code organized by using a separate 'Api' file for API requests. The main technologies used were React for the front-end and Date-fns for handling dates.
If I had more time, I would focus on enhancing the user interface and adding more features for user interaction.
