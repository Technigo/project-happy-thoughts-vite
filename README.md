### The Problem

We needed to do a Happy Thoughts Feed where we had to show the Thoughts of an API. You have to be able to add a thought and like a thought.

I started by sketching out the components and then starting with fetching the thoughts and then make your own thougt. Then I implemented the like button and how many minutes ago the post was done.

If I had more time I would add more validations to the input field.
