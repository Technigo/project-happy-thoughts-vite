# Happy thoughts Project

A project to be able to practice React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

## The Problem

During this project, I faced several challenges including structuring the components effectively, managing state between components, and implementing the like functionality. A significant part of the problem-solving involved handling data flow from the API, particularly with the POST requests for new thoughts and likes. Understanding how to implement and display timestamps required exploring different solutions, ultimately leading to using the date-fns library for more elegant time formatting. The project also involved careful consideration of user experience elements, such as error handling for the thought submission form and ensuring proper alignment of UI elements like the heart button and like counter.
