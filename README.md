# Happyy Thoughts Project

In this week's project, you'll be able to practice your React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone `https://github.com/stenlisuryadinata/project-happy-thoughts-vite.git`

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory.

Install project dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Open the project in your code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code):

```bash
code .
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```


### The Problem

In this project, you will build a social media application where users can share their happy thoughts with the world. You will fetch existing thoughts from an API, allow users to post new thoughts, like thoughts, and display a timestamp indicating when each thought was created.

### Key features of the project include:

Fetching and displaying existing thoughts from an external API.

Allowing users to post new thoughts with a character limit.

Tracking and displaying the number of likes for each thought.

Displaying a timestamp indicating when each thought was created.

Responsive design for various screen sizes.
Technologies Used

### The project is built using the following technologies:

React: For building the user interface and managing state.

JavaScript: For client-side scripting.

CSS: For styling and layout design.

External API: For fetching and posting thoughts data.
Future Improvements

### If you had more time, you could consider the following improvements:

User authentication: Implement user accounts and authentication for a personalized experience.

Pagination: Add pagination to the thought list to handle a large number of thoughts.

Commenting: Allow users to leave comments on thoughts.
User profiles: Create user profiles to display additional information about each user.

Thought filtering: Implement filters and search functionality for better thought exploration.
