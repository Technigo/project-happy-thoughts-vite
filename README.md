# Happy thoughts Project
In this week's project, we have been working with APIs again, this time in React. We should also apply what we learnt about the useEffect function and also been using useState. 

I have focused on dividing the project into different components and tried to make it as easy and understandable as possible. This time we also had to focus quite a lot on the styling and adapt it to the design we received. I thought it was a bit tricky with the useEffect but I looked a lot at the example we did on the tuesday session as well as the Q&A session on Thursday. I also found it difficult with the time conversion to be able to show the time stamp of the different posts and needed help from chatGPT for that. 

If I would have more time I would add the function to display max number of characters used. I did however add this as an if/else statement but it is not showing in the text area.
