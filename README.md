### The Problem

I started with fetching data fom the API and used Postman to check the response for both GET and POST methods. 
After that I went on with a POST function which was the tricky part. I ended up writing a lot of unnecessary code and I spent some time to resolve that without breaking it.
Last problem was to actually see where the useEffect hook took its' role. 

I had issues with my component structure. If I had more  time now, I would get it done properly and create more components to get more control over the code. And I would put more effort on CSS for the 'like'-buttons, add hover effect and a state for when the button is clicked.
