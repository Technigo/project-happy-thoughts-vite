# Happy thoughts Project
This weeks project was to practice React state by fetching and posting data to an API. I've created different components to structure the project and used both useState and useEffect.

### The Problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

I started out by sketching out my components on a piece of paper. When I started working in vs code I realised I wanted to re-organised it a bit and changed the structure of my components which made more sense to me. I took it step by step and started fetching the data from the API to make sure I could make it work. It took some time and I wanted to try to not use too much help this time. But I felt like it was very hard without turning to the web for help. So with some help from stack overflow, google and chatgbt I managed to make it work. Once I had the foundation layed out I created styling documents. The styling took a bit of time too for me. It seems like I change one thing and then something else that I didn't want to change, changes somehow. So it was a lot of trial and error. The heart icons for example changed color to black when I applied another font-family. Did some research and realised some fonts will change the colors on the icons. I solved it through changing the structure a bit in the css.

If I had more time I would work a bit more on the responsiveness. On smartphones my h2 element is separated into two lines and when I changed it in my css the whole box changed somehow.
