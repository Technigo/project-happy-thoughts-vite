### The Problem

I started with fetching data fom the API and used Postman to check the response for both GET and POST methods. 
After that I went on with a POST function which was the tricky part. I ended up writing a lot of unnecessary code and I spent some time to resolve that without breaking it.
Last problem was to actually see where the useEffect hook took its' role and how to make it work the way I wanted.
